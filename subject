Write a function that converts an integer value to a null-terminated string
using the specified base and stores the result in a char array that you must
allocate.

The base is expressed as an integer, from 2 to 16. The characters comprising
the base are the digits from 0 to 9, followed by uppercase letter from A to F.

For example, base 4 would be "0123" and base 16 "0123456789ABCDEF".

If base is 10 and value is negative, the resulting string is preceded with a
minus sign (-). With any other base, value is always considered unsigned.

Your function must be declared as follows:

char \*ft_itoa_base(int value, int base);

42 2

42 / 2 = 21 r0
21 / 2 = 10 r1
10 / 2 = 5 r0
5 / 2 = 2 r1
2 / 2 = 1 r0
1 / 2 = 0 r1
